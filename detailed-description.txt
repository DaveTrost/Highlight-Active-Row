This extension helps prevent mistaken data entry by making the currently selected table row more visible. Anytime an input box inside of a table is selected the entire table row gets its style changed. The goal is to make it extremely obvious which row you are currently inputting data on to reduce the chances of inputting data on the wrong row.


How it works:
The extension injects a small script that adds a 'focusin'/'focusout' event listener to the root document object. 

When the 'focusin' event fires it starts at the event.target & searches for the <tr> element and sets the  inline style to a preset highlight style.

When the 'focusout' event fires it starts at the event.target & searches for the <tr> element and clears the inline style.

** Currently has a hard set MAX_DEPTH of 5 which limits how many parents it will search before stopping. 
This should prevent all unnecessary DOM traversing for nodes not connected to a table, but also allow some wiggle room bif the input is in a div or two.

Future features:
>add an options page that allows the user to set a custom highlight style
>allow the user to enable/disable the extension for each website domain
